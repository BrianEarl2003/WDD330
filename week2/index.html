    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <p>
        Why did .join() not always allow the array data to be displayed in one element? (Undefined)<br>
        Is there a more accurate way to represent a number that results from dividing by a non-power of 2 in JavaScript?<br>
        Is it better to use a weak data structure like WeakSet() and WeakMap() or is it better to use map() and set() and just remember to cleanup unneeded data after?<br>
        Why can't return be used after the arrow notation in a single line anonymous function?<br>
      </p>
