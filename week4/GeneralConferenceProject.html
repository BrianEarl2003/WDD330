  <h2>General Conference Fall 2020 Sunday Morning</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>M Russell Ballard - Prayer</h3><br>
  <p>
    - Fear shall come upon all people.<br>
    - I plead with you to pray for this country, its national leaders, this people, your family...<br>
    - Ballard just had a medical procedure on his hand, and was distracted by the pain. He prayed in his office for
    relief and focus. He received the blessing almost immediately and completed his pressing tasks.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Lisa L Harkness - Faith</h3><br>
  <p>
    - Sometimes we feel desperate for help, even when we aren't in as much peril as we thought.<br>
    - "Carest not that we perish." The apostles were focused on survival and may not have had an eternal perspective
    during the storm. Christ asked why they lacked faith.<br>
    - "We do not need to let our fears displace our faith." Russell M Neilson<br>
    - Christ has given His life so that we will not perish.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Ulisses Saures - Purity</h3><br>
  <p>
    - Satan uses lust when he wants us to sin.<br>
    - Satan's influence will decrease on us as we invite the Spirit into our lives more and more.<br>
    - Entertaining even one inappropriate thought can eventually lead to a lot of sorrow.<br>
    - A clear field isn't filled with weeds overnight.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Carlos A Godoy - Fellowship</h3><br>
  <p>
    - He knew the church was true but sometimes felt discouraged and alone.<br>
    - He made a friend with someone who moved in the ward from another part of Brazil.<br>
    - Nurturing and strengthening is necessary in a recent convert's life.<br>
    - It is worth adjusting your lifestyle and your habits to the Lord's will.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Neil L Andersen - Jesus Christ</h3><br>
  <p>
    - Faith in Christ is declining in America and Europe.<br>
    - "Look unto me in every thought."<br>
    - If we utilize the atonement in our lives, then we must acknowledge Christ as the source.<br>
    - Do we have images of Christ in our homes and do we talk about Him often?<br>
    - Everything in our worship should point to Jesus Christ.<br>
    - As the world speaks less of Christ, let us speak more of Him.<br> 
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Russell M Nelson - Submissiveness</h3><br>
  <p>
    - Israel means "Let God prevail."<br>
    - Myopic means "near sighted." Jill had to expand her perspective instead of receiving the miracle she desired.<br>
    - Each of us has divine potential because we are each a child of God.<br>
    - God does not favor one race over another. God loves all of His children.<br>
    - Are you willing to have your will swallowed up in His?<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h2>General Conference Fall 2020 Sunday Afternoon</h2>
  <hr>
  <h3>Henry B Eyring - Trials</h3><br>
  <p>
    - God has the power to make our way easier.<br>
    - Why does God allow our mortal test to be so hard?<br>
    - Christ was not excempt from proving Himself.<br>
    - He knows how to succor us in the trials we face.<br>
    - Jesus forgave those who crucified Him.<br>
    - God allows us to suffer for as long as He wishes to polish us.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Jeremy R Jaggi - Patience</h3><br>
  <p>
    - A part of patience is accepting God's timing.<br>
    - The meek shall inherit the earth, the merciful shall obtain mercy and the peacemakers shall be called the children of God.<br>
    - The Lord will bless you as you continue to bless others.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Gary E Stevenson - Service</h3><br>
  <p>
    - The Japanese saints were so happy to hear the news of the Tokyo temple from Pres. Kimball that they all spontaneously erupted in applause.<br>
    - Many of us have endured hardship and heartache becuase of Covid19.<br>
    - There are many ways to serve during these times of social restrictions, like yardwork.<br>
    - Exceptions were made for missionaries to receive temple blessings early in the morning (2am) before their flights to their mission area.<br>
    - Christ was no stranger to affliction and descended below all things.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Milton da Rocha Camargo - Holy Ghost</h3><br>
  <p>
    - Everyone that asketh, receiveth. Asking reveals our intent.<br>
    - We would like to always feel the Spirit, confirming to us with great confidence that we are doing the right thing.<br>
    - But more often we may receive a still small voice that tells us to do our best and God will support us.<br>
    - We have the scriptures widely available to us and a prophet guiding us in the latter days. (No excuses)<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Dale G Renlund - Justice/Mercy</h3><br>
  <p>
    - We act honorably with God by walking humbly with Him.<br>
    - Learn to love mercy the way Heavenly Father and Jesus do.<br>
    - We can do this try treating others justly.<br>
    - That which is hateful unto you, do not unto others.<br>
    - We need to care for others without being judgemental.<br>
    - One man should not think himself above another.<br>
    - Disciples remember what God has done for them.<br>
    - My sins, that have been repented of, are not wounds that will never heal.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Kelly R Johnson - Gospel Knowledge</h3><br>
  <p>
    - His kids could only have music lessons if they practiced for 30 minutes every day.<br>
    - His microwave went up in flames because there was nothing on the inside to absorb the energy.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Jeffrey R Holland - Sacrifice</h3><br>
  <p>
    - Oh God where art thou. And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place.<br>
    - We are given challenges in this life that we may ask the same questions.<br>
    - God cares about the eternal life and exaltation of His children above all else.<br>
    - He administers the calender of miracles of our lives to each of us. We do not get to dictate the timing.<br>
    - Faith means trusting God in good and bad times. Even if it means suffering.<br>
    - Trying to live the ideal of avoiding suffering will never make you become like Christ.<br>
    - Living the Lord's will is never stress free.<br>
    - When will suffering end, by and by.<br>
    - Run and not be weary, walk and not faint.<br>
  </p>
  <hr>
  <h3>Russell M Nelson - Blessings</h3><br>
  <p>
    - This is the dispensation that no blessing will be withheld from the righteous.<br>
    - Make your new normal repentance and service.<br>
    - 6 new temples<br>
    - Be filled with the peace of Jesus Christ.<br>
