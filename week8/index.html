    <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <p>
        Why didn't all of the SGV, canvas and drag 'n' drop examples work?<br>
        What is the difference between data-src and src as image attributes?<br>
        Why wouldn't the data-src image attributes work properly but when I switched it to src it worked fine?<br>
        What is the difference between Raphael's Container and SVG/canvas?<br>
      </p>
